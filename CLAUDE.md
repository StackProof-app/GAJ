# GAJ (Get A Job)

A unified Claude Code skill for engineers managing their job search. Pipeline tracking, recruiter communication, cover letter generation, salary negotiation, and correspondence history in one install.

## Architecture

- **Type:** Claude Code skill with sub-commands (`gaj:X`)
- **Database:** SQLite via better-sqlite3 at `~/gaj/gaj.db`
- **Config:** YAML at `~/gaj/config.yaml`
- **Pattern:** Like GSD (`gsd:command`) or GVB (`viral:command`). One install, multiple slash commands.
- **Install:** `npx get-a-job@latest`

## Key constraints

- No external API dependencies. Uses the user's own Claude subscription through Claude Code.
- Anti-AI writing rules apply to all generated text. Output should not read like ChatGPT wrote it.
- SQLite is the only data store. No cloud database, no server.
- `~/gaj/` directory is created at runtime, not committed to the repo.
- Google Sheets sync is optional and requires the user's own OAuth credentials.

## Project management

PAUL framework files in `.paul/` track project state, plans, and roadmap. Do not modify `.paul/` files directly during feature work.
